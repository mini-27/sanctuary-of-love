                            Every year, I find myself looking back and feeling so thankful that you chose this path —
                            that
                            you worked so hard, that you never gave up, and that you debuted as part of ENHYPEN.
                            Watching
                            your journey from the beginning until now has been so special. You’ve grown not only as an
                            artist but as a person who continues to inspire with your passion, kindness, and quiet
                            strength.
                            <br />
                            I’m so glad I became an ENGENE, because it means I got to meet someone like you — someone
                            who
                            gives comfort through his voice and happiness through his smile. Thank you for being you,
                            for
                            sharing your music, and for letting us be part of your story. You deserve nothing but love,
                            peace, and joy. Happy birthday, Heeseung — I’m so proud of you, always.<span

                            Happy Birthday to you<br /><br />
                            Your not just my hero your also one of my biggest supporters even though you don't know
                            me.<br /><br />
                            24 years you've been on this planet and this is my 3rd year spending it with
                            you.<br /><br />
                            I hope you have a great day.<br /><br />
                            A memory I have while being here is when I first came here I was scared to put a profile pic
                            up
                            incase someone thought I would copy them so I put the pic at the bottom on. It pulled me in
                            and
                            I got to know the stage you then the real you.<br /><br />
                            You became the real reason I became an Engene cause you let me see being 20+ and being a kid
                            is
                            ok since I missed out most of my childhood for personal reasons.<br />
                            I hope you never change because your amazing and we love you no matter what.<br /><br />
                            Once again Happy Birthday Love you too the moon and back

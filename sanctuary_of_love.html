                            Every year, I find myself looking back and feeling so thankful that you chose this path —
                            that
                            you worked so hard, that you never gave up, and that you debuted as part of ENHYPEN.
                            Watching
                            your journey from the beginning until now has been so special. You’ve grown not only as an
                            artist but as a person who continues to inspire with your passion, kindness, and quiet
                            strength.
                            <br />
                            I’m so glad I became an ENGENE, because it means I got to meet someone like you — someone
                            who
                            gives comfort through his voice and happiness through his smile. Thank you for being you,
                            for
                            sharing your music, and for letting us be part of your story. You deserve nothing but love,
                            peace, and joy. Happy birthday, Heeseung — I’m so proud of you, always.<span

                            Happy Birthday to you<br /><br />
                            Your not just my hero your also one of my biggest supporters even though you don't know

                            A memory I have while being here is when I first came here I was scared to put a profile pic
                            up
                            incase someone thought I would copy them so I put the pic at the bottom on. It pulled me in
                            and
                            I got to know the stage you then the real you.<br /><br />
                            You became the real reason I became an Engene cause you let me see being 20+ and being a kid
                            is
                            ok since I missed out most of my childhood for personal reasons.<br />
                            I hope you never change because your amazing and we love you no matter what.<br /><br />
                            Once again Happy Birthday Love you too the moon and back

                            Advance Happy Birthday to my favorite Idol, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for
                            existing in this world. You maybe didn't know me, but you became the light on my darkest
                            days. Thank you for bringing laughter, joy, and comfort into my life. To be honest, I'm not
                            really into K-pop. Back then in 2023, but when I met you, I found comfort that I can't find
                            in others. You become my Solace. You become the reason why I keep fighting despite the
                            hardships in my life. You're the reason why I keep moving even if I'm tired. I'm not like
                            the other fans that want to marry you or see you as their boyfriend or husband because I see
                            you as my Kuya (Older Brother), a Kuya that brings comfort when I'm sad or happy, a Kuya
                            that gives inspiration. To be honest, someone I imagine going to your concert, meeting you
                            in person and the other members, and I also wonder what is the feeling of seeing you in
                            person. Not only your presence gives me comfort, but also your voice, actually your whole
                            personality. To be honest, I have a lot to say to you, but I know you will not see this
                            letter because thousands or millions of fans give you letters every day. Again, Happy
                            Birthday Kuya Hee. May your wishes and dreams come true, and good health for you. MAHAL
                            KITA.
